## Web Technologies
The platform was developed using a variety of web technologies to ensure that it is secure, reliable, and easy to use. The front-end is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are the standard web development languages. The back-end is built using PHP, a popular server-side programming language. The database is MySQL, which is a popular relational database management system. The platform is deployed as a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means that it can be installed on mobile devices and accessed offline.
